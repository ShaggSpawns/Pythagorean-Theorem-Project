	Pythagoras is often referred to as the first pure mathematician. He was born in Samos Greece, around 
569 BC, to Mnesarchus, his father, and Pythais, his mother. Mnesarchus was a gem merchant while Pythais was most 
likely stayed home. Pythagoras had two to three brothers and no known sisters.

	Pythagoras enjoyed learning about philosophy, music, mathematics, and astronomy from Pherekydes, 
Thales, and Anaximander (philosophy, mathematics and astronomy, and philosophy / geometry respectively). After 
learning these teachings, he became well educated and decided to move to Egypt to study with the priests in the 
temples of Egypt. He will carry the teachings he learned from the priests for the rest of his like, and can be seen in 
his later teachings in his lifetime. Of these teachings were the Egyptian codes of secrecy, refusal to eat beans or wear 
animal skins, and striving for purity. He spent around ten years in Egypt before it was invaded by Persia, where 
Pythagoras was taken prisoner.

	After Pythagoras was taken prisoner, he was sent to Babylon. He learned sacred rites from the Magoi, 
priests. Five years later (520 BC), Pythagoras left Babylon, after being set free, and landed back in Samos, his home 
town. After returning, he set up a school that he named "The Semicircle", but because the leaders of Samos did not 
like his teaching and their aspirations for him to get involved with politics, he embarked onto a new place to call 
home.

	Around 518 BC, Pythagoras arrived in a Greek colony named Crotona in southern Italy. He created a 
philosophical and religious school, this is were many of his followers worked and lived. Pythagoras and his followers 
created a community where they called themselves Pythagoreans. The Pythagoreans lived by a very strict set of 
philosophies, of these were ones that Pythagoras was taught by the Egyptian priests, such as what they wore and how 
they ate. All of the followers of Pythagoras were known as mathematikoi, while Pythagoras was the master. All 
mathematikoi who were apart of the school were all vegetarians and didn't own personal possessions. Pythagoras 
also had other followers that weren't apart of the school, and so they were allowed to own personal possessions and 
could eat meat.

	The Pythagoreans lived by the beliefs that all things could be represented by numbers and that the 
basis of everything was mathematics, with geometry being of the highest form. Also, they believed that the soul in in 
the brain, and through a series of reincarnation, where it moves from human to human and even human to animal, the 
soul becomes pure. In addition to the soul becoming purified through reincarnation, music could also purify. They 
believed that number have personalities, characteristics, strengths and weaknesses. Also, that the world depends on 
opposites and that certain symbols have a mystical significance. Finally, they believed that all members of the society 
should observe strict loyalty and secrecy.

	Pythagoras spent the rest of his life with the Pythagorean society, working on many theories such as 
the the theorem of Pythagoras, which states that for a right-angled triangle the square on the hypotenuse is equal to 
the sum of the squares on the other two sides. The Babylonians, 1000 years later, understand this proof that 
Pythagoras proved. Pythagoras death, around 500 - 475 BC in Italy, is not clear but most report him dying by an angry
mob who were caught up in the Agrigentum-Syracusans war. 
	
	Even though Pythagoras' theorem is still to this day, one of the most important theorems in geometry, 
it is uncertain weather or not Pythagoras' theorems were all of his own work and not just a mathematikoi who put 
Pythagoras' name on it. Despite this problematic controversy, Pythagoras is still, to this day, to be one of the most 
important mathematicians in the history of geometry.
